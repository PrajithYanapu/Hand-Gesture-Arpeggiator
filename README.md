# 🎶 Hand Gesture Arpeggiator

Real-Time Hand-Controlled Music & Visual Experience

An interactive web application that transforms hand gestures into music and audio-reactive 3D visuals using computer vision.

Built with MediaPipe, Three.js, and Tone.js, this project demonstrates real-time gesture recognition, audio synthesis, and creative web technologies—all running directly in the browser.

🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ Real-time computer vision with live audio control
✔ No hardware required — works with a standard webcam
✔ Combines AI + graphics + audio in a single web app
✔ Clean, modular JavaScript architecture
✔ Strong showcase project for Frontend, Full-Stack, AI, and Creative Developer roles

🎯 Core Features
# ✋ Hand #1 — Arpeggiator Control

Raise hand → increase pitch

Pinch gesture → control volume dynamically

# 🥁 Hand #2 — Drum Machine Control

Different raised fingers → change rhythm patterns

# 🌈 Audio-Reactive 3D Visuals

Real-time Three.js visuals that respond to sound energy

Smooth animations synced with music output

# 🎥 Live Hand Tracking

Accurate multi-hand detection using MediaPipe

Low-latency gesture recognition
